# Interface Adjustments

Below are my personal adjustments to the Mod Organizer 2 interface. Take them as suggestions.

# Log

I recommend disabling the log at the bottom as it is mostly unnecessary:

# The Right Pane

The *right pane* of Mod Organizer 2 features a number of tabs, none of which require much space to properly display. I typically reduce it take up about a fourth of the entire interface, dragging around the columns in the **Plugins** tab so that all options are comfortably displayed without wasting too much space on the **Mod Index** column.

# The Left Pane

The *left pane* of Mod Organizer 2 displays the **mod order**.

Clicking on the sorting columns above the mod order, you will see a number of options.

## Flags

- ✔️**Conflicts:** Displays little icons to show overwrites.
- ✔️**Flags:** Not necessary, but recommended. Shows if notes are appended to a mod.*
- ✔️**Content:** Very helpful because it shows you which types of assets are contained in a mod.
- ❌**Category:** Uses Nexus categories by default. Separators are better for sorting.**
- ❌**Nexus ID:** The ID of the respective mod (which is the combination of numbers at the end of its URL).
- ✔️**Source Game:** Useful when mixing Skyrim LE and Skyrim SE mods which is not very common anymore.
- ✔️**Version:** Helpful for tracking updates.
- ❌**Installation:** Displays the date of installation. 
- ✔️**Priority:** Shows the position in the mod order. 
- ✔️**Notes:** See short notes at a glance. Essential if you document edits in MO2.

<font size=2>\**There are also flags to remind you of endorsing mods and to show the tracking status. The tracking feature never worked properly for me and the only mods I have not endorsed are my own, so I typically disable both **Endorsement Integration** and **Tracking Integration** in the MO2 settings (Nexus tab). Disable these features or leave them active, it is up to you.*</font>

<font size=2>\*\**You can also create a set of custom categories (instructions forthcoming).*</font>

# MO2 Layout

The layout below is a recommendation. Adjust the interface in your MO2 instance as you see fit.
