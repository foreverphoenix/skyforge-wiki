# The Skyforge Project

The **Skyforge Project** is a beginner's guide and knowledge base for modding Skyrim SE created by members of the **Aetherius Modding** community. We aim to provide a comprehensive instructions to enthusiast-level modding and teach the skill set required to build a consistent, stable, and high-quality modded setup for Skyrim.

## What is "Modding"?

A distinction is generally made between people who create mods and people who download mods to build a custom setup. This distinction becomes increasingly blurry in high-level Skyrim modding.

To build a setup that is truly *yours* there is no choice but to dip your toes into mod-making, be it for a patch, custom edits to an existing mod, or to creating something from scratch when you realise nobody else has done it yet.

> **Learning how to mod requires time and effort.**
> The more ambitious you are, the bigger and the more complex your dream modlist, the more time and effort it will take. Modding, like any other skill, requires a degree of commitment.
