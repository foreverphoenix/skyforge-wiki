# Tools Folder

I recommend keeping all your modding tools in a unified **Tools** folder.

When it comes to picking an installation directory for tools, you have two options:

1) Inside the MO2 directory: `\Mod Organizer 2\Tools\`.
2) Inside a new high-level folder: `Drive:\Tools\`

The Tools folder must be <u>on the same drive</u> as Mod Organizer 2.

## Inside MO2

While tool creators often warn against running tools from within the MO2 directory, Wabbajack list authors have done just that for years with no issues *that I am aware of*.

Keeping tools within your MO2 instance is only necessary if you want to include them in a Wabbajack list.

## Outside MO2

I recommend using a centralised, shared folder for every setup that is not supposed to become a Wabbajack list. Advantages include the ability to share tools between setups and even games (Skyrim SE and Fallout 4 share many tools). They are also easier to update.

## Version Numbers

When adding to your Tools folder, I recommend including the version number in the name of the folder to better be able to keep track of which versions you installed. This does require you to update the folder name in the MO2 executable settings after updating a tool, but that becomes routine quickly enough.

Below, you can see my shared Tools folder:

# Mod Organizer 2 Plugins

Mod Organizer 2 is extensible with plugins. Some, like the texture preview, are pre-installed while additional third-party plugins can be installed separately.

Always install plugins into the `\Mod Organizer 2\plugins\` folder and restart MO2 afterwards.
