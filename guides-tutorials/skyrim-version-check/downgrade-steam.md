# Downgrade Skyrim

If there has been a recent Skyrim SE update, the modding community may not have caught up yet in which case <u>downgrading to the last supported version of Skyrim is recommended</u>.

The process is made painless by halgariâ€™s automatic downgrade patcher.

- Determine which version of **Skyrim SE** you are on and which version you require ([instructions](/guides-tutorials/version-check)).
- Download the corresponding full patcher from [the mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?tab=files) (click **Manual Download**).
  - *You will probably find the required version under **Old Files** (use CTRL+F to search).*
- Move the downloaded executable to your installation under `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\`.
- Run the executable and wait for it to finish (should take only a few seconds).

To prevent Skyrim from automatically updating, consider 
**update proofing** the game.
