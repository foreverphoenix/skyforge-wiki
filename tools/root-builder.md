# About Root Builder

**Root Builder** is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which enables root folder file management through MO2. When the game or a tool is launched through MO2, all root folder files will be *temporarily* moved into the actual root folder by the plugin. When the game or tool is closed, those files will automatically be removed again from the root folder.

There are multiple advantages to using **Root Builder**:

- The root folder will always stay clean and vanilla, and there will be no overlap between multiple modded setups.
- This allows you to run a personal setup and a Wabbajack list independently from each other.*
- All files are managed through Mod Organizer 2 for easy activation/deactivation, version control, custom notes, etc.

<font size=2>\**All setups must run the same version of Skyrim to share a root folder. However, most Wabbajack lists that are not on the latest version use the Stock Game folder system (see below) and will thus not interfere at all.*</font>

> If all root folder files are dropped into the root folder it can become difficult to tell which files are vanilla and which are mod-added, and, if they are mod-added, which version is currently installed. This gets nowhere near as bad as an unmanaged data folder, but it is inconvenient. Root Builder prevents this.

**With Mod Organizer 2 and Root Builder you can build an almost completely self-contained modded setup.\***

<font size=2>\**We could use the Stock Game folder system and create an entire new copy of the vanilla game files (i.e., the root folder) to make the setup fully self-contained. However, that would add about 13GB of files without offering any meaningful benefits for most regular users.*</font>

> While Root Builder is not perfect, the issues that I have encountered with the plugin (in over a year of heavy use) are very minor and easy to fix. While not everyone likes the plugin, I personally find it invaluable and highly recommend it.
