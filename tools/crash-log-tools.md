# About Crash Log Tools

**Crash Log Tools** is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2 which adds the ability to view crash logs generated by Crash Logger directly through the MO2 UI. This is far more convenient than navigating manually to where the logs are saved under `\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\`.

Additionally, the plugin will attempt to label known addresses in crash logs which may help with tracking down the cause of a crash.

## Installation

Crash Log Tools is available on the Nexus.
 
- Download the latest version of [Crash Log Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66743?tab=files).
- Extract the downloaded archive into the **plugins** folder.
- Restart Mod Organizer 2.

## Usage

You should now be able to access **Crash Log Tools** through the Toolbar:
