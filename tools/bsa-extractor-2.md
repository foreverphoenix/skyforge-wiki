# Installation

The default BSA extraction plugin packaged with Mod Organizer 2 may currently corrupt textures when used to unpack BSAs, so I recommend installing a fixed version.

- Close Mod Organizer 2.
- Download [BSA Extractor 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92044?tab=files) from the Nexus page.
- Extract the contents of the **plugins** folder to `\Mod Organizer 2\plugins\`.

## Configuration

By default, BSA Extractor 2 will ask about unpacking the archive every time you install a mod that contains a BSA. This can be disabled and I recommend doing so.

- Restart Mod Organizer 2 and go into the [Settings](/getting-started/initial-setup/mo2-open-settings.png). 
- Switch to the **Plugins** tab and select **BSA Extractor 2** near the bottom of the list.
- Double-click **enable_install_dialogue** and set it to **False**.
