# Tool Installation

Before installing any tools listed below I recommend creating a dedicated **Tools** folder.

- [Tools Folder *How and where to set up a modding tools folder.*](/en/tools/tools-folder)
{.links-list}

# Mod Organizer 2 Plugins

Mod Organizer 2 is extensible with plugins. Some, like the texture preview, are pre-installed while additional third-party plugins can be installed separately.

Always install plugins into the `\Mod Organizer 2\plugins\` folder and restart MO2 afterwards.
