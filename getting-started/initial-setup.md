# Skyrim Setup

Many versions and ports of Skyrim SE exist and not all are usable for modding. The **Skyforge** resources are written specifically for the *Steam* or *GOG* version of **Skyrim Special Edition** (Skyrim SE).

> With very few exceptions, the ideal version for modding is currently Skyrim SE 1.6.640 (Steam) or 1.6.659 (GOG).

- **Skyrim Legendary Edition** (SLE) has been superseded by Skyrim SE.
- The **PC Gamepass** and **Console** versions of Skyrim SE are too limited for modding.
- The **VR** port of Skyrim is similar to but not the same as Skyrim SE.

The **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** (AE) is a DLC for Skyrim SE containing all Creations and has no immediate impact on modding. Whether you own it is irrelevant.

## Clean Install

Install either the Steam or GOG version of Skyrim:

- [Steam Installation *How to install the Steam version of Skyrim SE.*](/getting-started/initial-setup/steam)
- [GOG Installation *How to install the GOG version of Skyrim SE.*](/getting-started/initial-setup/gog)
