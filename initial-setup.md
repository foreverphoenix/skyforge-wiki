# Skyrim Setup

Many versions and ports of Skyrim SE exist and not all are usable for modding. The **Skyforge** resources are written specifically for the *Steam* or *GOG* version of **Skyrim Special Edition** (Skyrim SE).

> For the vast majority, the ideal version for modding is currently Skyrim SE 1.6.640 (Steam) or 1.6.659 (GOG).
{.is-success}

- **Skyrim Legendary Edition** (SLE) has been superseded by Skyrim SE.
- The **PC Gamepass** and **Console** versions of Skyrim SE are too limited for modding.
- The **VR** port of Skyrim is similar to but not the same as Skyrim SE.

The **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** (AE) is a DLC for Skyrim SE containing all Creations and has no immediate impact on modding. Whether you own it is irrelevant.

## Clean Install

Perform a clean install of either the Steam or GOG version of Skyrim:

- [Steam Installation *How to install the Steam version of Skyrim SE.*](/en/initial-setup/steam)
- [GOG Installation *How to install the GOG version of Skyrim SE.*](/en/initial-setup/gog)

# Mod Organizer 2

With Skyrim all set up, it is time to create a new instance of Mod Organizer 2 with a custom set of INI files and optionally some useful third-party extensions.

- [Mod Organizer 2 *How to set up Mod Organizer 2 for Skyrim SE.*](/en/initial-setup/mod-organizer-2)
{.links-list}

## MO2 Plugins

All Mod Organizer 2 plugins listed below are *optional*. I recommend installing at least **BSA Extractor 2** and **Mod Load Order Checker**.

- [BSA Extractor 2 *Fixes file corruption when extracting BSAs.*](/en/tools/bsa-extractor-2)
- [Curation Club *Allows you to quickly import Creations as mods.*](/en/tools/curation-club)
- [Root Builder *Enables management of root folder files.*](/en/tools/root-builder)
- [Mod Load Order Checker *Creates a warning when plugins are loaded out of order.*](/en/tools/mod-load-order-checker)
- [Crash Log Tools *Improves crash logs and makes them accessible through MO2.*](/en/tools/crash-log-tools)
- [LOOT Warning Checker *Integrates LOOT warnings into the MO2 warning system.*](/en/tools/loot-warning-checker)
- [NIF Preview *Adds the ability to preview and compare meshes side-by-side.*](/en/tools/nif-preview)
{.links-list}

# INI Files

Various settings for the vanilla game can be configured in the Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini files. I recommend using BethINI to configure and optimise the set of INIs attached to your Mod Organizer 2 profile. This will not affect the default set under `\<Your User Name>\Documents\Skyrim Special Edition\`.

- [INI Configuration *How to modify the vanilla INI files with BethINI.*](/en/initial-setup/ini-config)
{.links-list}

# Creations

- [Creation Club *What is the Creation Club?*](/en/knowledge-base/creation-club)
{.links-list}

Since Skyrim SE 1.6.x, everyone owns at least the four free Creations (Fishing, Survival, Rare Curios, Saints & Seducers), though not everyone picked up the remaining Creations or the full Anniversary Edition DLC.

Forgoing the AE DLC should not negatively impact your modding experience but skipping the four free Creations is difficult as an increasing amount of mods, including the *Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch*, now require them. Skipping the USSEP significantly complicates matters because so many other mods require it.

Even if you are completely opposed to using the four free Creations, I recommend installing them. **Survival Mode** can be easily neutralised by disabling the prompt and the mediocre **Saints & Seducers** quest can be completely replaced with a full remake. Finally, the **Fishing** quests can be removed by installing the reduced cut. This may be a good compromise between removing poor quality Creation content from your game while still being able to keep the plugins as master files to dependent mods like the USSEP.

## Managing Creations

# Script Extender

The Skyrim Script Extender is one of the most important mods/tools for Skyrim. It is required by a multitude of mods, including most essentials, which is why it should always be installed.

## SKSE Installation
