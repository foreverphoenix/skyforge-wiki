# Synthesis

**Synthesis** is an automated patching tool that is capable of processing a large amount of plugins in a short period of time and apply changes from one or more pre-made patchers. Mods are increasingly coming to rely on Synthesis-generated patches to ensure easy compatibility and integration.

## Installation

Synthesis can be downloaded from Github.

- Download the **Synthesis.zip** from the latest version on [Github](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases).
- Create a folder called **Synthesis** in your **Tools** folder.
- Extract the downloaded archive into the new folder.

## MO2 Integration

Synthesis requires access to the data folder and must therefore be launched through Mod Organizer 2.

- Open the [executable settings](/basics/mo2-executables-settings.png) in Mod Organizer 2.
- Click the small blue plus icon and select **Add from file**.
- Navigate to your **Synthesis** folder and double-click **Synthesis.exe**.
- Click **OK** to add the executable to Mod Organizer 2.

I recommend selecting the tool from the executables drop-down and adding a shortcut to the Toolbar for quick access.

# Synthesis Profile

Upon launching Synthesis for the first time you will be able to configure it for your version of Skyrim.

- Select **Skyrim** and then **Skyrim Special Edition** (Steam) or **Skyrim Special Edition GOG**.

> It is possible to create multiple profiles for different games, all using the same instance of Synthesis.
