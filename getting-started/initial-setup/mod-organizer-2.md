# Mod Organizer 2

Mod Organizer 2 has two prerequisites.

While you may already have them install, I recommend (re)installing them to be sure:

    Download .NET Framework 4.8 and follow the instructions in the installer.
    Download the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and follow the instructions in the installer.

To finalise the installation you may be required to restart your PC.
