# The Skyforge Project

The **Skyforge Project** is a beginner's guide and knowledge base for modding Skyrim SE created by members of the **Aetherius Modding** community. We aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to enthusiast-level modding and teach the skill set required to build a consistent, stable, and high-quality modded setup for Skyrim.

## What is "Modding"?

A distinction is generally made between people who create mods and people who download mods to build a custom setup. This distinction becomes increasingly blurry in high-level Skyrim modding. To build a setup that is truly *yours* there is no choice but to dip your toes into mod-making, be it for a patch, custom edits to an existing mod, or to create something from scratch that nobody else has made yet.

**Learning how to mod requires time and effort.** The more ambitious you are, the bigger and the more complex your dream modlist, the more time and effort it will take. Modding, like any other skill, requires a degree of commitment.

The good news is: **There is no magic involved in modding Skyrim.** If there is a problem, there is a reason for it, and with at least a basic understanding of how mods are structured and how they function you can painlessly fix most issues or prevent them from occurring to begin with. All it takes is some **patience** and the **willingness to read**.
