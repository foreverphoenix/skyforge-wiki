# BSA Profile

**Cathedral Assets Optimizer** can be used to pack and unpack BSAs (archives). A dedicated profile is helpful for quick access to the correct configuration.

## New Profile

When creating a new profile, use the pre-made profile for the same game as the base.

- Open **Cathedral Assets Optimizer** and make sure the **SSE** profile is selected at the top.
- Check the option to **Show advanced settings**.
- Click the **New** button to create a new profile and click **OK** to the infobox.
