# Skyrim Setup

Many versions and ports of Skyrim SE exist and not all are usable for modding. The **Skyforge** resources are written specifically for the *Steam* or *GOG* version of **Skyrim Special Edition** (Skyrim SE).

> For the vast majority, the ideal version for modding is currently Skyrim SE 1.6.640 (Steam) or 1.6.659 (GOG).
{.is-success}

- **Skyrim Legendary Edition** (SLE) has been superseded by Skyrim SE.
- The **PC Gamepass** and **Console** versions of Skyrim SE are too limited for modding.
- The **VR** port of Skyrim is similar to but not the same as Skyrim SE.

The **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** (AE) is a DLC for Skyrim SE containing all Creations and has no immediate impact on modding. Whether you own it is irrelevant.

## Clean Install

Perform a clean install of either the Steam or GOG version of Skyrim:

- [Steam Installation *How to install the Steam version of Skyrim SE.*](/en/getting-started/initial-setup/steam)
- [GOG Installation *How to install the GOG version of Skyrim SE.*](/en/getting-started/initial-setup/gog)

# Mod Organizer 2

With Skyrim all set up, it is time to create a new instance of Mod Organizer 2 with a custom set of INI files and optionally some useful third-party extensions.

- [Mod Organizer 2 *How to set up Mod Organizer 2 for Skyrim SE.*](/en/getting-started/initial-setup/mod-organizer-2)
{.links-list}

## MO2 Plugins

All Mod Organizer 2 plugins listed below are *optional*. I recommend installing at least **BSA Extractor 2** and **Mod Load Order Checker**.

- [BSA Extractor 2 *Fixes file corruption when extracting BSAs.*](/en/tools/bsa-extractor-2)
- [Curation Club *Allows you to quickly import Creations as mods.*](/en/tools/curation-club)
- [Root Builder *Enables management of root folder files.*](/en/tools/root-builder)
- [Mod Load Order Checker *Creates a warning when plugins are loaded out of order.*](/tools/mod-load-order-checker)
- [Crash Log Tools *Improves crash logs and makes them accessible through MO2.*](/en/tools/crash-log-tools)
- [LOOT Warning Checker *Integrates LOOT warnings into the MO2 warning system.*](/en/tools/loot-warning-checker)
- [NIF Preview *Adds the ability to preview and compare meshes side-by-side.*](/tools/nif-preview)
