# More Informative Console

*More Informative Console* turns the console from a decently useful into an invaluable dev tool. Its most immediate usecase is checking the Form ID of a given object (it helpfully displays both Base and Ref ID) or to see which mesh the object is using, but it can display a variety of other information, including an NPC's factions, inventory, etc.

**Requirements:** Skyrim Script Extender, Address Library for SKSE
