# Regular Installation

This page covers how to install the [Skyrim Script Extender](/mods/skse) the old-fashioned way <u>without</u> [Root Builder](/mo2/root-builder).

## Root Folder Files

Open the downloaded archive and extract the following files into the **root folder**:

- skse64_1_6_640.dll
- skse64_loader.exe

<font size=2>*There used to be a third DLL, skse64_steam_loader.dll, that was part of SKSE. It is no longer required as of SKSE 2.2.3.*</font>

- Restart Mod Organizer 2.

The Skyrim Script Extender should have been automatically detected and added to the **Executables** drop-down.

## Data Folder Files

Install the mod as usual through Mod Organizer 2.

- Expand the **skse64_2_xx_xx** folder.
- *Right-click* the **Data** folder and select **Set as \<data> directory**.
- Click **OK** to install the mod.
