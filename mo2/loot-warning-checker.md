# LOOT Warning Checker

The **LOOT Warning Checker** plugin integrates warnings from the [LOOT](/tools/loot) masterlist into the Mod Organizer 2 warnings system.

## Installation

LOOT Warning Checker is available on the Nexus.

- Download the latest version of [LOOT Warning Checker](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/323?tab=files).
- Extract the **LOOT-Warning-Checker** folder from the downloaded archive into the **plugins** folder.
- Restart Mod Organizer 2.

## Toggle Warnings

LOOT warnings can be helpful, but they are not infallible. For example, the tool may warn you about a missing patch when, in fact, you have replaced this patch with a custom plugin specific to your load order.

To prevent MO2 from constantly complaining about unnecessary warnings, I recommend keeping the LOOT warnings toggled <u>off</u> for the most part. You can re-enable them every once in a while to see if something relevant shows up.
