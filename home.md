# The Skyforge Project

The **Skyforge Project** is a beginner's guide and knowledge base for modding Skyrim SE created by members of the **Aetherius Modding** community. We aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to enthusiast-level modding and teach the skill set required to build a consistent, stable, and high-quality modded setup for Skyrim.

## What is "Modding"?

A distinction is generally made between people who create mods and people who download mods to build a custom setup. This distinction becomes increasingly blurry in high-level Skyrim modding. To build a setup that is truly *yours* there is no choice but to dip your toes into mod-making, be it for a patch, custom edits to an existing mod, or to create something from scratch that nobody else has made yet.

**Learning how to mod requires time and effort.** The more ambitious you are, the bigger and the more complex your dream modlist, the more time and effort it will take. Modding, like any other skill, requires a degree of commitment.

The good news is: **There is no magic involved in modding Skyrim.** If there is a problem, there is a reason for it, and with at least a basic understanding of how mods are structured and how they function you can painlessly fix most issues or prevent them from occurring to begin with. All it takes is some patience and the willingness to read.

# Getting Started

Still here? Great!

Regardless of whether you are at the start of your journey or already have some modding experience under your belt, the Skyforge Project endeavours to provide you with the tools and knowledge to realise your dream modlist - eventually.

We offer two approaches.

## Beginner's Guide

For newcomers to the modding scene, the Beginnerâ€™s Guide offers a step-by-step introduction into the basics of modding. It assumes no pre-existing knowledge and will take you through the process from the very beginning with each step building onto the previous one. It does require you to follow the instructions to the letter (unless otherwise specified) so that by the end of it you are ready to strike out on your own.

Interested in the guided approach? Start here.

## Modular

If you are not entirely new to modding, much of the ground covered in the **Beginner's Guide** may already be familiar to you. Instead, you may be interested in referencing the various articles hosted on this website as you build up your setup.
