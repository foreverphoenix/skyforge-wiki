# LOD Resources

LOD Resources are used to improve LODs generated with [SSELODGen](/tools/sselodgen) or [DynDOLOD](/tools/dyndolod). You always need the DynDOLOD Resources, Scripts, and DLL as well as the SSE-Terrain-Tamriel-Extend, the installation instructions for which are covered in the linked modules for the respective tools.

## Mod Order

- xLODGen Resource - SSE Terrain Tamriel
- DynDOLOD Resources
- DynDOLOD - Scripts and DLL
  - *NG or regular.*
- Far Object LOD Improvement Project

# Far Object LOD Improvement Project

Far Object LOD Improvement Project (FOLIP) adds resources for DynDOLOD 3 generation. It is mainly used to add **roads** to the map for *A Clear Map of Skyrim and Other Worlds* but also adds LODs for the glowing mushrooms in Blackreach and the Tundra Homestead creation.
